  Subjack is a Subdomain Takeover tool written in Go designed to scan a list of subdomains concurrently and identify ones
  that are able to be hijacked. With Go's speed and efficiency, this tool really stands out when it comes to mass-testing.
  Always double check the results manually to rule out false positives.
  
  Subjack will also check for subdomains attached to domains that don't exist (NXDOMAIN) and are available to be
  registered. No need for dig ever again! This is still cross-compatible too._

  This repository is an implementation of [Ostorlab Agent](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/)
  for [Subjack](https://github.com/haccer/subjack) (Subdomain Takeover tool).
  
  ## Getting Started
  
  To perform your first scan, simply run the following command.
  
  ```shell
  ostorlab scan run --install --agent agent/mohsinenar/subjack domain-name example.com
  ```
  
  This command will download and install `agent/mohsinenar/subjack` and target domain `example.com`.
  For more information, please refer to
  the [Ostorlab Documentation](https://github.com/Ostorlab/ostorlab/blob/main/README.md)
  
  ## Usage
  
  Agent Subjack can be installed directly from the ostorlab agent store or built from this repository.
  
  ### Install directly from ostorlab agent store
  
   ```shell
   ostorlab agent install agent/mohsinenar/subjack
   ```
  
  You can then run the agent with the following command:
  `ostorlab scan run --agent agent/mohsinenar/subjack domain domain-name example.com`
  
  ### Build directly from the repository
  
  1. To build the nmap agent you need to have [ostorlab](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) installed in your machine. If
     you have already installed ostorlab, you can skip this step.
  
  ```shell
  pip3 install ostorlab
  ```
  
  2. Clone this repository.
  
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/mohsinenar/agent_subjack.git && cd agent_subjack
  ```
  
  3. Build the agent image using ostorlab cli.
  
   ```shell
   ostorlab agent build --file=ostorlab.yaml
   ```
  
  You can pass the optional flag `--organization` to specify your organisation. The organization is empty by default.
  
  4. Run the agent using on of the following commands:
      * If you did not specify an organization when building the image:
       ```shell
       ostorlab scan run --agent agent//subjack ip 8.8.8.8
       ```
      * If you specified an organization when building the image:
       ```shell
       ostorlab scan run --agent agent/[ORGANIZATION]/subjack ip 8.8.8.8
       ```
