  This repository is an implementation of [Ostorlab Agent](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) for the [dnsReaper subdomain takeover tool](https://github.com/punk-security/dnsReaper) by punk-security.  
  ## Getting Started  
  To perform your first scan, simply run the following command:  
  ```shell  
  ostorlab scan run --install --agent agent/mohsinenar/dns_reaper domain-name sub.domain.com  
  ```  
  ## Installation & Usage  
    
    
   ### Install directly from ostorlab agent store  
   ```shell  
   ostorlab agent install agent/mohsinenar/dns_reaper  
   ```  
  You can then run the agent with the following command:  
  ```shell  
  ostorlab scan run --agent agent/mohsinenar/dns_reaper domain-name sub.domain.com  
  ```  
  ### Build directly from the repository  
   1. To build the nmap agent you need to have [ostorlab](https://pypi.org/project/ostorlab/) installed in your machine.  if you have already installed ostorlab, you can skip this step.  
  ```shell  
  pip3 install ostorlab  
  ```  
   2. Clone this repository.  
  ```shell  
  git clone https://github.com/mohsinenar/agent_dns_reaper.git && cd agent_dns_reaper  
  ```  
   3. Build the agent image using ostorlab cli.  
   ```shell  
   ostortlab agent build --file=ostorlab.yaml  
   ```  
   You can pass the optional flag `--organization` to specify your organisation. The organization is empty by default.  
   4. Run the agent using on of the following commands:  
     * If you did not specify an organization when building the image:  
      ```shell  
      ostorlab scan run --agent agent//dns_reaper ip 8.8.8.8  
      ```  
     * If you specified an organization when building the image:  
      ```shell  
      ostorlab scan run --agent agent/[ORGANIZATION]/dns_reaper ip 8.8.8.8  
      ```
    # usage scenario
    
    ## Scan all subdomains For a specefic domain.
    This agent  can be used with other agents from ostorlab store. to perform a full scan on a specefic target.
    
    Let say we want to scan all subdomains of `example.com` and `example2.com` for subdomain takeover 
    we can simply use https://github.com/Ostorlab/agent_subfinder to collect all subdomains of example.com & example2.com and dns_reaper will pick all subdomais from subfinder and run a scan on them.
    by running the following scan command 
    
    ```shell
    ostorlab scan run -i --agent=agent/mohsinenar/dns_reaper --agent=agent/ostorlab/subfinder  domain-name example.com example2.com
    ```
